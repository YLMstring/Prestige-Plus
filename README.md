# Prestige Plus v2.9.9 for WoTR 
## Requirements: [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu). [TTT-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core).

- This mod adds a lot of character options to the game, especially combat maneuvers and prestige classes!
- All features are toggleable.

## Featuring

### Combat Maneuver+
- You can Disarm, Sunder, or Trip in lieu of a melee attack, and Bull Rush in lieu of a charge attack, like on tabletop!
- [Seize the Opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/path-of-war/feats/seize-the-opportunity-combat/): From Path of War
- Kinda OP so you can make it a mythic feat instead of combat feat if you like (default off)
- [Dirty Fighting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/dirty-fighting-combat/)
- [Surprise Maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/surprise-maneuver/)
- [Strength Surge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo-rage-powers/strength-surge-ex/)
- [Ki Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/ki-throw-combat/) and its mythic feat!
- [Improved Ki Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-ki-throw-combat/)
- [Binding Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/binding-throw-combat/)
- [Enhanced Ki Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/enhanced-ki-throw-combat/)
### [Grapple Mechanic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#Grapple)
![Grapple](https://github.com/YLMstring/Prestige-Plus/assets/61271096/0fa718b4-4dbe-4cf2-8e5d-e4d19b696999)
- This is how I implement it:
1. There are 3 kinds of grapples in the game. My Grapple Mechanic is very close to tabletop. Shifter and beast shape grapples stay owlcat-brew but once the character takes Grapple (Improved Grapple) feat, their grapple mechanics would be turned into mine. Finally, monster grapples stay the way it is in vanilla.
2. If you are grappled, you can attempt to break the grapple by making a combat maneuver check (DC equal to your opponent’s CMD; this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) or Thievery check (with a DC equal to your opponent’s CMD). If you succeed, you break the grapple as a standard action. However, if you fail nothing happens, you don't use your standard action.
3. You can only tie up pinned creatures, and then they still need to be grappled. The rope would be bursted if you release grapple, because you don't have time to tie someone up properly in combat. They are not helpless but can become the target of Coup De Grace. Additionally, grapple actions against them auto-succeed, they're auto pinned by the rope and their Thievery check DC to escape is higher.
- Added Feats: Grapple (Improved Grapple), Greater Grapple, Rapid Grappler, Unfair Grip, Pinning Knockout, Pinning Rend, Savage Slam, Dramatic Slam, Hamatula Strike, Throat Slicer

If you don't want these feats, my mod doesn't require anything, as the original feature will still be there.
### [Furious Guardian Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/e-h/furious-guardian/)
- Chosen Ally is for barbarian standard rage only =-=

- Image of Divinity: At 7th level, a heritor knight’s appearance changes to superficially resemble the Inheritor herself, although she is still recognizable to those who know her, and her statistics do not change.
- This is absolutely my favorite.
### [Horizon Walker Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/apg/horizon-walker/)
- The Terrain Mastery abilities of Astral Plane and Abyss are actually useless in the module but they are prerequisites for their Terrain Dominance.
- There isn't a GM available telling which creature is native to where, so ONLY ABYSS's favored enemy bonus works, for demons (which is written explicitly in the its description). And you guys probably won't focus on other creatures anyway lol

#### Homebrew Options:  
- [Cloying Shades](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/paizo-rogue-talents/cloying-shades-su) functions as [Bardic Pretender](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/paizo-rogue-talents/bardic-pretender-ex/) for the class entry!
### [Mammoth Rider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/i-m/mammoth-rider/)
- Gigantic Steed gives stackable bonus instead of size bonus. It just doesn't make any sense that this can't stack with magical enlarge effect!

- The class has 10 levels, but I only implement the first 3 levels because it doesn't have good stuff at higher levels.
#### Homebrew Options:  
- Become an Angel of Death early! (requires precise shot)
- Feat: Extra Tyrant’s Discipline
### [Scar Seeker Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/s-z/scar-seeker/)

#### Homebrew Options:  
- Summon Shadow: You can choose an animal companian instead and make it undead!
- Shadow Jump: You can choose any feat from the dimentional feat chain instead! This requires [Microscopic Content Expansion mod](https://github.com/alterasc/MicroscopicContentExpansion/). If you don't want these feats, my mod doesn't require anything, as the original feature will still be there.

### New Mythic Prestige Class Features

- Swift Death: Your target assassination becomes a standard action. At 10th assassin level, it becomes a move action.
- Greater Swift Death: Your target assassination becomes a move action. At 10th assassin level, it becomes a swift action.
- Unbreakable Defense: You no longer have a limited amount of Defensive Stance rounds per day.
- Draconic Wings: The disciple gains two primary wing attacks that deal 1d4 damage.
- Endless Breath: You have 1/3 chance to recover one use of your breath weapon at the start of your turn. Additionally, your Gold Dragon Breath (Mythic) becomes a move action.
- Riposte (Mythic): The duelist adds her mythic tier as a bonus on her attack roll when attempting a parry and riposte. This bonus does not stack with Ever Ready mythic feat.
- Metaphysical Sneak Attack: If the student of war deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target, allowing him to apply his Know Your Enemy effects. Additionally, his sneak attack no longer deals precision damage.
- Mystic Catalyst: You can use Lesser Spell Synthesis ability at will. 
### Other Features

- [Quick Draw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/s-z/swordlord/): If a Swordlord already has Quick Draw or Alertness, he gains Aldori Dueling Mastery as a bonus feat.
- [Catechesis](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/e-h/hellknight-signifer/): If a Hell Knight signifer has the Warrior Priest feat, his Hell Knight signifer level stacks with other divine spellcasting classes for determining the effects of those classes’ domain powers. This doesn’t grant any new powers or abilities. In addition, a signifer with the Warrior Priest feat gains Selective Channel as a bonus feat.
- Estimated THC: Show hit chance and spell (not) saved chance in turn based mode. This is not precise because it doesn't take into consideration certain effects such as concealment, spell penetration or conditional save bonus, but still better than nothing, eh? (default off)
- Infernal Healing: You can fully heal outside of combat by spending gold, as if you buy a wand of infernal healing and use it! (gold : hp = 3:2)
- Weak Crits against Enemies: Symmetrical with owlcat weak crits settings, making it fair (default off)
- Fix Difficulty CMD Tripple-Dipped: This will significantly reduce enemy CMD at higher difficulties. CMD is calculated by adding STR bonus, DEX bonus and AC bonus, which means difficulty stat advancement is applied 3 times in vanilla, leading to total madness.
- Fix Power Attack: now working as descripted: This bonus to damage is halved (–50%) if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon. Note that Piranha Strike has the same bug but it isn't fixed because this might give Piranha Strike an edge over Power Attack, which is pretty coool.
